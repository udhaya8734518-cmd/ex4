            Tirumalai Kovil is a famous Murugan temple located near Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu. The temple is dedicated to Lord Murugan (also known as Subramaniya Swamy), and it is built on top of a hill, offering a beautiful view of the Western Ghats and surrounding villages.
The temple is believed to be very ancient and is considered sacred by devotees of Lord Murugan. Pilgrims climb the steps to reach the shrine, which creates a spiritual and peaceful experience. The temple attracts large crowds during festivals like Thaipusam and Panguni Uthiram, when special poojas and celebrations take place.
Tirumalai Kovil is not only a religious spot but also a scenic location where visitors can enjoy nature, fresh air, and the traditional architecture of Tamil Nadu.
