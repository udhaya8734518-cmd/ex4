            Piranoor is a small town located near Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu. It lies on the way to the famous Courtallam waterfalls, making it a well-known spot for travelers and tourists. The town is popular for its fruit stalls, especially mangoes and jackfruits, which are sold in abundance during the season.
Piranoor is also known for its old checkpost area, as it was once a significant border point between the Travancore kingdom and Tamil Nadu. Even today, people visiting Courtallam or nearby tourist attractions often stop at Piranoor to enjoy fresh fruits and snacks.
The town is surrounded by greenery and hills from the Western Ghats, giving it a scenic backdrop. Piranoor’s combination of natural beauty, local produce, and historical significance makes it a charming place in the Tenkasi region.
