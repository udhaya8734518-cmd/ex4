            Ilanji is a small town located near Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu, India. It is situated at the foothills of the Western Ghats and is well known for its pleasant climate and natural surroundings. The town is often called the “Triveni Sangamam of the South” because three rivers — Chittar, Hanumanathi, and Korayaru — meet here.
Ilanji is also famous for its ancient temples, traditional culture, and lush greenery. The town lies close to popular tourist spots like Courtallam waterfalls and Tirumalai Kovil, making it an important stop for visitors exploring the Tenkasi region. Agriculture is the main livelihood of the people, and the fertile land supports crops like paddy, banana, and coconut.
